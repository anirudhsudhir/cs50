1. By using the following SQL query, the audio aura of a person could be determined
SELECT AVG(energy),AVG(valence),AVG(danceability) FROM songs;

2. The user might have listened to songs having different energies, valence and danceabilities various number of times.
Although the number of plays of a particular song might be higher, the average does not take this into count and
uses the top 100 songs to characterize the aura.

A better way to perform the operation would be to calculate the average values of the top songs the user listened to
by taking into account the number of plays of each song.
