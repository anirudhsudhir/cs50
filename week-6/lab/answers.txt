Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
Initially, Brazil seemes to have a higher chance of winning with a lower number of simulations. This proved incorrect as the number of simulations was increased.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
10000 simulations seem to be sufficient as the predictions remain similar after that with the winner remaining the same
